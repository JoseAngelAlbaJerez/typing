# Typing Test Web App
This is a simple web application for practicing typing skills. It provides a typing test with a timer, mistake counter, and a dynamically generated quote for typing practice.

## Features:
### Timer and Mistake Counter:

The timer counts down from 60 seconds, and a mistake counter keeps track of the number of mistakes made during typing.


### You can start and stop the typing test using the "Start" and "Stop" buttons.

### The application fetches a random quote from the Quotable API on page load.
The quote is displayed with individual characters that highlight success and failure during typing.

### Result Display:

After completing the typing test or upon stopping, the result, including accuracy and typing speed (words per minute), is displayed.
